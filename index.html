                            Our Cardano based NFT, or CNFT, will be able to function as avatars and admit owners into the metaverse.

                                    experience within the field. In 1996, DR Kelly founded his own telemedicine company

                                    My name is Affandi, but most people know me as Circle Purple. I was born in Indonesia.
                                    My first experience as a digital artist was when I worked on several band albums
                                     and made merchandise. 
                                     <br>
                                     <br>
                                     I was influenced by several digital artists, such as: Dunmumpord, Kimjunggius, 
                                     as well as many others. With more than 6 years of experience as a digital artist, 
                                     I have been trusted to work on a wide variety of projects.

                                    Recently, I saw an opportunity to become an NFT artist and I started my journey with The CardaLordz 
                                    Team as a digital artist.
