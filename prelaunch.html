                        All religions throughout time share the universal principle of fairness. 
                        The wisdom of the gods guiding our project, we seek to hold ourselves to the highest 
                        standards of fairness possible. Our primary goal is to assist others in their own spiritual journey.

                      <p>
                        Behold the arbiter of fair distribution. To leave the distribution of tokens to a 
                        human arbiter could lead them to the temptation of deceptive practices. Driven by statistics 
                        and tested with game theory, we can ensure a fair user experience.
                        <br><br>
                        We prayed about it and meditated on the best way to distribute the tokens and give back to the community.
                        By using a data driven model of distribution, all players will be given an equal roll regarding which nft they receive.

                        We believe by using Cardano as our primary currency, instead of Ethereum, we can avoid the 
                        network clogging that comes with the Ethereum NFT boom.  Cardano is still new to the NFT 
                        space with many of the elements of our project being unique to Cardano based NFTs.

                        The token minting will be managed from the CardaLordz presale website.  
                        To reward those of good faith who stood by us from the beginning, we will do an initial sale 
                        to our earliest active members. The Gods will then be minted and distributed based on the algorithm 
                        in preset batches to promote stability. 
                        <br><br>
                        Once a god has been reserved through the website during the sale, you will then send us the 
                        applicable minting fee. We will then send one of our gods to your wallet.
